                On March 15, 1999, the Sangguniang  Panlungsod ng Pasig passed Ordinance No. 11, Series of 1999, establishing the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig, and appropriated funds for its operations. The authority of the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Pasig to establish the Pamantasan is Article III, Sections 447, 458, 468 of the Local Government Code of 1991 which allowed institutions to be established and operated by Local Government Units.
                <br><br>
                The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig was part of the Pasig City Development Plan of 2000, and the City’s response to the challenges of the new millennium. Consistent with the vision of its founder, the University utilizes all the modern facilities available in the city: the City Library, the Computer Center, the Sports Complex, the Convention Center, the Museum, the Livelihood Center, the Youth Training Center, the Rain Forest Park and Recreational Facilities, Day Care Centers and the Basic Education schools situated in the City. In effect, the University campus is the entire city of Pasig itself offering quality education and ultimately, the good life to all Pasigueños.
                <br><br>
